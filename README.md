AMS Project — Automobile Maintenance System (WIP)
About This Project

AMS (Automobile Maintenance System) is a vehicle maintenance data analysis project that focuses on predictive maintenance and monitoring vehicle component conditions.

This project was created as an exploration of data analysis and machine learning to understand component degradation patterns and support earlier maintenance decisions.

The project is still in development.
